# Realtime Data Distribution (EventHub)

Realtime Data Distribution app demos an event hub for real-time ingestion, analytics, and distribution of events using Macormeta GDN. With the app, the event publisher can publish the event into a GDN stream, and using the GDN stream processer you can generate analytics based on real-time data. In the demo, you can view analytics such as `Top securities sentiment`, `Securities sentiment`, and alongside all the real-time events.
